This directory contains my code labs, exercises, and study notes from following **[Beej's Guide to C Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/)**. While the main repository covers the basics, this section focuses on how C works "under the hood."

> **🎯 Learning Goal:** This deep dive into C is specifically aimed at understanding memory management, pointers, and system I/O for future **Command & Control (C2) framework development**. Mastering these low-level concepts is crucial for Red Team operations and malware development.

## 📝 Study Notes

### 🧵 String Theory (String Termination)
In C, a "string" isn't a primitive type like in Python or Java. It is defined by two specific characteristics:

1.  **The Head**: A pointer to the first character in the string.
2.  **The Tail**: A zero-valued byte (`\0` or NUL character) somewhere in memory after the pointer that indicates the end.

#### Key Rules for String Manipulation:
*   **Copying**: To make a copy of a string, you must copy it **byte-by-byte**. You cannot just assign the variable (that only copies the pointer/address!).
*   **Allocation**: Before copying a string, you **MUST** ensure you have allocated enough memory (an array or malloc) to hold the destination.

> **Reference Functions:**
> - `strlen()`: Calculates length by counting bytes until `\0`.
> - `strcpy()`: Copies bytes from source to destination until `\0`.

### 🏹 The Arrow Operator (`->`)
The arrow operator is primarily used when referring to fields inside **pointers to structs**.

#### Why use pointers to structs?
There are basically two main cases when you’d want to pass a pointer to a struct instead of the struct itself:

1.  **Efficiency**: The struct is large, and it’s more expensive to copy that entire data structure onto the stack than it is to just copy a small pointer (memory address).
2.  **Mutability (State Change)**: You need the function to be able to make changes to the struct that was passed in, and have those changes show in the caller.

**Example:**
```c
void setPrice(struct truck *t, float newPrice) {
    // "t" is a pointer, so we use arrow to dereference AND access the field
    t->price = newPrice; 
}
```

### 📂 File I/O & Streams
All I/O in C is handled through the `FILE*` type, which holds the state of the stream (position, status, etc.).

#### Standard Streams
| `FILE*` Name | Description | Default Source/Dest |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `stdin` | Standard Input | Keyboard |
| `stdout` | Standard Output | Screen/Console |
| `stderr` | Standard Error | Screen/Console |

#### Text vs Binary
1.  **Text Streams**: Use `fgetc()`, `fgets()`, `fscanf()` to read, and `fputc()`, `fputs()`, `fprintf()` to write.
2.  **Binary Files**: Raw stream of bytes.
    *   **Mode**: Must add `"b"` to the mode string (e.g., `"rb"` for read binary, `"wb"` for write binary).
    *   **Functions**: `fread()` and `fwrite()` to handle raw byte buffers.

> **🕵️‍♂️ Red Team Note:**
> Binary file handling (`fread`/`fwrite`) is critical for **data exfiltration**.
> *   *Concept:* Read sensitive files as raw binary.
> *   *Challenge:* Need to implement **obfuscation/encryption** (XOR, AES) on the buffer before writing or sending it to the C2 server to avoid detection.
