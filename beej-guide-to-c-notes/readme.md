## 📝 Study Notes

### 🧵 String Theory (String Termination)
In C, a "string" isn't a primitive type like in Python or Java. It is defined by two specific characteristics:

1.  **The Head**: A pointer to the first character in the string.
2.  **The Tail**: A zero-valued byte (`\0` or NUL character) somewhere in memory after the pointer that indicates the end.

#### Key Rules for String Manipulation:
*   **Copying**: To make a copy of a string, you must copy it **byte-by-byte**. You cannot just assign the variable (that only copies the pointer/address!).
*   **Allocation**: Before copying a string, you **MUST** ensure you have allocated enough memory (an array or malloc) to hold the destination.

> **Reference Functions:**
> - `strlen()`: Calculates length by counting bytes until `\0`.
> - `strcpy()`: Copies bytes from source to destination until `\0`.

### 🏹 The Arrow Operator (`->`)
The arrow operator is primarily used when referring to fields inside **pointers to structs**.

#### Why use pointers to structs?
There are basically two main cases when you’d want to pass a pointer to a struct instead of the struct itself:

1.  **Efficiency**: The struct is large, and it’s more expensive to copy that entire data structure onto the stack than it is to just copy a small pointer (memory address).
2.  **Mutability (State Change)**: You need the function to be able to make changes to the struct that was passed in, and have those changes show in the caller.

**Example:**
```c
void setPrice(struct truck *t, float newPrice) {
    // "t" is a pointer, so we use arrow to dereference AND access the field
    t->price = newPrice; 
}
```

### 📂 File I/O & Streams
All I/O in C is handled through the `FILE*` type, which holds the state of the stream (position, status, etc.).

#### Standard Streams
| `FILE*` Name | Description | Default Source/Dest |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `stdin` | Standard Input | Keyboard |
| `stdout` | Standard Output | Screen/Console |
| `stderr` | Standard Error | Screen/Console |

#### Text vs Binary
1.  **Text Streams**: Use `fgetc()`, `fgets()`, `fscanf()` to read, and `fputc()`, `fputs()`, `fprintf()` to write.
2.  **Binary Files**: Raw stream of bytes.
    *   **Mode**: Must add `"b"` to the mode string (e.g., `"rb"` for read binary, `"wb"` for write binary).
    *   **Functions**: `fread()` and `fwrite()` to handle raw byte buffers.

> **🕵️‍♂️ Red Team Note:**
> Binary file handling (`fread`/`fwrite`) is critical for **data exfiltration**.
> *   *Concept:* Read sensitive files as raw binary.
> *   *Challenge:* Need to implement **obfuscation/encryption** (XOR, AES) on the buffer before writing or sending it to the C2 server to avoid detection.

### 🎭 Typedef & Abstraction
The `typedef` keyword allows you to create an alias for an existing type. While useful for cleaner code, it also serves a strategic purpose in obfuscation.

#### Use Cases:
1.  **Anonymous Structs**: Define a struct and its alias in one go, so you never have to write `struct Name` again.
2.  **Pointer Hiding**: You can `typedef` a pointer type (e.g., `typedef int *HANDLE;`).
    *   *Pros:* Makes code "abstract" and cleaner to read.
    *   *Cons:* Hides the fact that the variable is a pointer, which can lead to confusion if not careful.

> **🕵️‍♂️ Red Team Note:**
> Typedefs are excellent for **obfuscation**. By renaming common types (or pointers to shellcode) to mundane names like `GraphicsContext` or `PixelData`, you can sometimes confuse simple static analysis or human analysts looking at your code. Hiding the `*` (pointer) inside a typedef makes the data flow harder to track visually.

### 🔄 QuickSort & Function Pointers
The standard library function `qsort()` demonstrates the power of **Function Pointers**. Instead of writing a sort algorithm from scratch, you pass:
1.  The array to sort.
2.  The size of the array.
3.  The size of each element.
4.  A pointer to a **comparison function** that defines the sort logic.

#### ⚠️ The `sizeof` Trap
A common bug when iterating or sorting arrays is using `sizeof(array)` and expecting the element count.
*   `sizeof(array)`: Returns total **bytes** (e.g., 5 ints * 4 bytes = 20 bytes).
*   **Correct Count**: `sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0])`.

> **🕵️‍♂️ Red Team Note:**
> **Function Pointers** (Callbacks) are a cornerstone of malware development.
> *   *API Hooking:* You overwrite a function pointer in memory to redirect execution to your malicious code.
> *   *Indirect Execution:* Instead of calling `VirtualAlloc` directly (which is flagged by AV), you might find a pointer to it in memory and call it dynamically to hide your intent.

### 💾 Manual Memory Management
Memory on the **Heap** must be manually managed. This gives you control but also responsibility.

1.  **`malloc(size)`**: Allocates `size` bytes. **Contains garbage** (uninitialized).
2.  **`calloc(count, size)`**: Allocates `count * size` bytes. **Zeroes out memory** (safe).
3.  **`realloc(ptr, new_size)`**: Resizes an existing block. Useful for growing buffers when reading files of unknown size.
4.  **`free(ptr)`**: Returns memory to the system. Forgetting this causes **Memory Leaks**.

> **🕵️‍♂️ Red Team Note:**
> *   **Shellcode Loading:** Standard `malloc` allocates **RW** (Read-Write) memory. To run shellcode, you typically need **RWX** (Read-Write-Execute) memory. In real malware, you'll use OS-specific APIs like `VirtualAlloc` (Windows) or `mmap` (Linux) to control these permissions.
> *   **Heap Exploitation:** Understanding how `malloc` organizes chunks of memory is the first step to learning **Heap Overflows** and **Use-After-Free** exploits.

### 🌑 Void Pointers (`void *`)
A `void *` is a "generic" pointer type. It holds a memory address, but C doesn't know what *type* of data is stored there.

*   **The Power**: You can write functions that handle **any data type** (e.g., `memcpy`, `qsort`).
*   **The Limitation**: You **cannot** dereference (`*p`) or do arithmetic (`p++`) on a void pointer directly because the compiler doesn't know the size of the item.
*   **The Fix**: You must **cast** it to a specific type (like `char *` for byte-level access) before using it.

### 🏎️ Pointer Arithmetic
Pointer arithmetic is the underlying mechanism of arrays.
*   **Formula**: `a[b] == *(a + b)`
*   **Movement**: Adding `1` to a pointer moves it forward by `sizeof(type)` bytes, not just 1 byte.

> **🕵️‍♂️ Red Team Note:**
> *   **Scanning Memory**: Pointer arithmetic is how you scan memory for "Egg Hunters" (looking for a specific signature of your shellcode) or parse PE headers in memory to find kernel32.dll.
> *   **Buffer Overflows**: Understanding that `buf[i]` is just `*(buf + i)` helps visualize how writing past the bounds (`buf[100]` in a size 10 array) literally writes into the *next* variable's memory address.

### 🔢 Data Types & Limits
Understanding the exact size of data types is critical when crafting payloads or shellcode.

| Type | Typical Size (Bytes) | Range Macro (Min/Max) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `char` | 1 | `CHAR_MIN` / `CHAR_MAX` |
| `short` | 2 | `SHRT_MIN` / `SHRT_MAX` |
| `int` | 2 or 4 | `INT_MIN` / `INT_MAX` |
| `long` | 4 or 8 | `LONG_MIN` / `LONG_MAX` |
| `long long` | 8 | `LLONG_MIN` / `LLONG_MAX` |
| `float` | 4 | - |
| `double` | 8 | - |

*   **Unsigned Variants**: Always start at `0` and go up to `U<TYPE>_MAX` (e.g., `UINT_MAX`).
*   **Headers**: Use `<limits.h>` for integers and `<float.h>` for floats.





### 🔣 Number Bases & Representation
In systems programming and exploitation, you rarely work with Base 10.
1.  **Hexadecimal (`0x`)**: `int x = 0x1A2B;` - Used for memory addresses and machine code.
2.  **Octal (`0`)**: `int x = 012;` - Often used for Unix file permissions (e.g., `0755`).
3.  **ASCII**: `char` types are just 1-byte integers mapped to characters. `char a = 10;` is a valid integer value (newline).

> **🕵️‍♂️ Red Team Note:**
> *   **Hex Dumps**: You must get comfortable reading Hex. A buffer overflow payload or a network packet capture will always be viewed in Hex.
> *   **Shellcode**: Shellcode is often represented as a C string of hex values: `"\x90\x90\xeb\x04..."`.
> *   **ASCII Strings**: One of the quickest wins in Reverse Engineering is running the `strings` command on a binary to see what text is embedded (IP addresses, error messages, passwords).

### 🧪 Type Literals & Suffixes
When writing constants, you can specify their type explicitly using suffixes (case-insensitive).

| Type | Suffix | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `long` | `L` | `1234L` |
| `long long` | `LL` | `1234LL` |
| `unsigned` | `U` | `1234U` |
| `unsigned long` | `UL` | `1234UL` |
| `float` | `F` | `3.14F` |
| `long double` | `L` | `3.14L` |

> **Tip:** `double` is the default for floating point numbers (e.g., `3.14`).
